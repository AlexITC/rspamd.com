	<h2>Performance</h2>
	<p>Rspamd is optimised to work as fast as possible. There are numerous optimisations that allow mail to be processed faster. 
     Rspamd uses an event based processing model and does not block anywhere in the code. Moreover, it is possible to use multiple threads
     for parallelising complex tasks and multiple processes to serve requests. This allows the processing of hundreds of messages per second
     without significant CPU load.</p>
