# DCC module

This modules performs [DCC](http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/) lookups to determine
the *bulkiness* of a message (e.g. how many recipients have seen it).

Identifying bulk messages is very useful in composite rules e.g. if a message is
from a freemail domain *AND* the message is reported as bulk by DCC then you can
be sure the message is spam and can assign a greater weight to it.

Please view the License terms on the DCC website before you enable this module.

## Module configuration

This module requires that you have the `dccifd` daemon configured, running and
working correctly.  To do this you must download and build the [latest DCC client]
(https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/source/dcc.tar.Z).  Once installed, edit
`/var/dcc/dcc_conf` set `DCCIFD_ENABLE=on` and set `DCCM_LOG_AT=NEVER` and
`DCCM_REJECT_AT=MANY`, then start the daemon by running `/var/dcc/libexec/rcDCC start`.

Once the `dccifd` daemon is started it will listen on the UNIX domain socket /var/dcc/dccifd
and all you have to do is tell the rspamd where `dccifd` is listening:

~~~ucl
# local.d/dcc.conf

enabled = true;

# Define local socket or TCP servers in upstreams syntax
# When sockets and servers are definined - servers is used!

socket = "/var/dcc/dccifd"; # Unix socket (1.8.1+)
# host = "/var/dcc/dccifd"; # Unix socket (Before 1.8.1)

#servers = "127.0.0.1:10045" # OR TCP upstreams (1.8.1+)
timeout = 2s; # Timeout to wait for checks

~~~

Alternatively you can configure DCC to listen to a TCP Socket on localhost or any remote server.
For the detailed configuration have a look to the DCC manual. Here is the config line for having DCCIFD
listening on localhost port 10045 and allowing 127.0.0.1/8 to query:
`DCCIFD_ARGS="-SHELO -Smail_host -SSender -SList-ID -p *,10045,127.0.0.0/8"`

The Rspamd dcc.conf now looks like this:

~~~ucl
# local.d/dcc.conf

enabled = true;

# Define local socket or TCP servers in upstreams syntax
# When sockets and servers are definined - servers is used!
#socket = "/var/dcc/dccifd"; # Unix socket

servers = "127.0.0.1:10045" # OR TCP upstreams (1.8.1+)

#host = "127.0.0.1:10045" # OR TCP upstreams (Before 1.8.1)
#port= "10045" # OR TCP upstream (Before 1.8.1)

timeout = 2s; # Timeout to wait for checks

~~~

Using servers not sockets you are able to configure all [upstreams](https://rspamd.com/doc/configuration/upstream.html) features.


Once this module is configured it will write the DCC output to the rspamd as each
message is scanned:


~~~
2018-09-28 13:35:17 #2998(normal) <37f431>; lua; dcc.lua:169: sending to 127.0.0.1:10045
2018-09-28 13:35:17 #2998(normal) <37f431>; dcc; dcc.lua:136: DCC result=R disposition=R header="X-DCC--Metrics: srv.ncxs.de 1481; bulk Body=2 Fuz1=2 Fuz2=many"
~~~

Any messages that DCC returns a *reject* result for (based on the configured `DCCM_REJECT_AT`
value) will cause the symbol `DCC_BULK` to fire.
