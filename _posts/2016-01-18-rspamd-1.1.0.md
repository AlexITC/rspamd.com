The next major release of rspamd: `1.1.0` is now released. In this version, I did another bunch of
architectural rework. This time, I've refactored fuzzy storage, regular expressions processing and statistics primarily. 

A number of features that I was asked constantly about have been added to rspamd, including such features as:

* **Autolearning** for BAYES: statistics can learn on good or bad messages automatically
* **Redis** backend for statistics to enable distributed and fast redis storage for rspamd cluster
* **Scalable fuzzy storage**: it is now possible to scale hashes storage across multiple processes to process thousands of requests per second

There is also major performance improvement: [hyperscan](https://github.com/01org/hyperscan) engine support for optimizing regular expressiosn execution.

With this version, I have added a lot of documentation, including [tutorials](https://rspamd.com/doc/tutorials/) and improved [quick start guide](/doc/quickstart.html).

Here is the full changelog for this version available on github: <https://github.com/vstakhov/rspamd/blob/1.1.0/ChangeLog>

The new version is almost 100% backward compatible with `1.0` branch but please check the [migration](/doc/migration.html) document if you are using per-user statistics and rspamd-1.0.
