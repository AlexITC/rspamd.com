The next stable release of rspamd has been published. Here is a list of notable changes for 1.0.5 release:

* Add rspamd control interface:
	- support `stat` command to get runtime stats of rspamd workers
	- support `reload` command to reload runtime elements (e.g. sqlite3 databases)
* Rework curve25519 library for modular design:
	- add Sandy2x implementation by Tung Chou
	- fix CPU detection for variables loading assembly
	- add testing for curve25519 ECDH
* New fixed strings library
* Add `R_SUSPICIOUS_IMAGES` rule

Less important changes:

* Enable mmap in sqlite3
* Use new strings in the HTTP code
* Improve google perftools invocation
* Improve performance profiling in http test
* Reorganize includes to reduce namespace pollution
* Allow specific sections printing in configdump command
* Rework workers signals handlers to be chained if needed
* Update socketpair utility function
* Add control_path option for rspamd control protocol
* Fix ownership when listening on UNIX sockets
* Rework signals processing in main
* Remove extra tools from rspamd (they live in rspamadm now)
* Remove global rspamd_main
* Add global timeout for the overall task processing (8 seconds by default)
* Sanitize NULL values for fuzzy backend
* Store NM between encrypt/decrypt
* Add textpart:get_words_count method
* Fix generic DNS request in lua
* Tune hfilter weights
* Add support of IPv6 in hfilter
* Fix parsing of HTTP headers with IP addresses
* Sync with the recent libucl
* Various minor bugfixes


This version is partially backward compatible with `1.0.0`. Here is the incompatible change:

	Signing, configuration test and other side options have been removed from the main rspamd binary in honor of
	`rspamadm` utility which provides drop-in replacement for all functions removed. The main functionality of `rspamd`
	binary has not been changed.

Please update your scripts if they use `rspamd -t` or similar things to the according `rspamadm` invocation, for example
`rspamadm configtest`.
