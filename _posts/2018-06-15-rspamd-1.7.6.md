We have released **Rspamd 1.7.6** today. There are no incompatible changes
introduced with this version to our best knowledge.

## The most important features and fixes

* Fix multiple neural networks support: it is now possible to learn multiple neural networks with different settings as documented
* Rework `rspamadm` to use mostly Lua for subcommands for better documentation and extensions support
* Add pubkey checks for `dkim_signing` module (#2277)
* DMARC reports are now compressed using gzip as suggested by RFC
* Settings module can now skip message processing to improve performance
* Bayes classifier now consider more metatokens from the headers
* ED25519 DKIM signatures are now supported
* Fixed serious issues with composites, maps and other components
* Major memory leak hunting and eliminating (especially those that occurs during reload)
* Add more tests and allow to create fake DNS records to make certain tests self-contained (e.g. DKIM or DMARC)
